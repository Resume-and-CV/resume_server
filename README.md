# resume_server

`resume_server` acts as the robust backend infrastructure for `resume_web`, a dynamic web-based resume platform. This server is engineered to manage and securely serve the personal and professional data required by the `resume_web` frontend, offering a seamless user experience. Utilizing Node.js and Express, `resume_server` efficiently handles API requests, interfaces with a MySQL database for data persistence, and employs JWT for secure user authentication. This component is essential for individuals aiming to showcase their software development skills, whether for attracting potential employers or securing internships in the IT sector.

## Features

- **Secure Data Management**: Manages the storage, retrieval, and updating of user information securely.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for accessing personal, educational, and professional data.
- **User Authentication**: Leverages JWT for secure authentication and session management, ensuring data protection.
- **Dynamic Content Delivery**: Serves dynamic content updates to the `resume_web` frontend, facilitating real-time display of user data.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes MySQL for robust data storage and retrieval, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: Serves as the server-side runtime environment, enabling JavaScript execution for backend processes.
- **Express**: Offers a powerful and flexible framework for creating web applications and RESTful APIs, simplifying server-side logic.
- **MySQL**: Provides a reliable and scalable database solution for storing user data and application state.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Ensures secure communication between client and server, safeguarding user sessions and personal information.

## Installation

To deploy and run `resume_server` locally, follow these steps:

1. **Repository Cloning**:
   Clone the `resume_server` repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Resume-and-CV/resume_server.git
   cd resume_server
   ```

2. **Dependencies Installation**:
   Install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   Configure your `.env` file with necessary environment variables, including database connection details and authentication secrets.

   DB_HOST=This is the hostname of your database server.
   DB_USER=This specifies the username for your database login.
   DB_PASSWORD=This is the password for your database user.
   DB_DATABASE=This indicates the name of the database you want to use.
   PORT=3001 This determines the port number on which your server will listen for incoming connections. The default is set to 3001,

   JWT_SECRET=This is your chooshing secret key.

4. **Server Startup**:
   Launch the server by executing:
   ```
   node app.js
   ```
   Upon successful launch, the server will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` or another port as configured.
